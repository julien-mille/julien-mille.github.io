        <h1>Research</h1>
	<p>
	<!--Since september 2009, I have been working in the <a href="http://liris.cnrs.fr">LIRIS</a> (<i>Laboratoire d'InfoRmatique
	en Image et Syst&egrave;mes d'information</i>, which you would translate by Computer Science Laboratory in Imaging and Information Systems),
	in the <a href="http://liris.cnrs.fr/imagine/">Imagine</a> team.-->
	I am particularly interested in image and video analysis, especially object detection, segmentation and tracking using optimization methods.
	</p>
				  
	<h4>Joint segmentation and tracking</h4>
				  
	<p>
	My research first focuses on joint segmentation and tracking of multiple objects within image sequences. The extraction of moving objects is performed through spatiotemporal segmentation, formulated as an energy minimization problem. The energy to be optimized is designed according to the various assumptions made on spatial and temporal consistency of appearance, shape and motion of objects and background. I am interested in both continuous (variational) optimization using multiple level set functions, as well as discrete labeling problems, related to Markov Random Fields and graph cuts.</p>

	Especially, a part of my work deals with the formulation of novel local data terms devoted to region tracking. For example, this can be performed by matching color statistics between successive frames. A common underlying assumption in this context is that color statistics can be confidently estimated in a global manner over object and background regions. This can be a drawback for tracking in real scenes with cluttered backgrounds, where statistical color data is highly scattered, preventing the estimation of reliable color statistics for object/background discrimination. To overcome this limitation, an approach based on a <i>short-sight</i> modeling of background is proposed, which concentrates on the vicinity of tracked objects and thus extract more consistent statistical data for region separation.

        <h4>Closed contour extraction using minimal paths</h4>
	<p>
	Minimum cost paths have been extensively studied tools for image segmentation with prior interaction. Provided a set of user-provided landmark points along the boundary of interest, paths are computed between these points in order to build a closed contour. Optimality is the main advantage of such approaches, since in most cases, a minimum cost path can be efficiently found as the global solution of the corresponding minimization problem, as Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in directed graphs.
	</p>

	<p>
	A path between two landmark points may be optimal according to the chosen edge-based cost function (the potential), but might turn out irrelevant when assembled with paths emanating from other landmark points to build a closed contour. Given two endpoints, other good paths can be built in addition to the shortest one. These potentially good paths are introduced as <i>admissible</i> paths.
